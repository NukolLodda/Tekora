# Tekora

Tekora is a tech based mod for Minecraft and a base mod for future mods planned for the Tekora Development Team.
<br>
Tekora plans to implement a whole host of machines into Minecraft using most naturally occurring elements of the<br>
periodic table

-----
**Requests**

I mainly take bug fix requests and they will generally be my top priority
however, I will still take some requests to add or remove specific features
<br>
Tekora has a doc of planned features that should all be realized by version 4
and as such is not flexible to new ideas.

-----
**Addons**

Tekora will likely have a couple of dependencies to it since some of the code
in Tekora is rudimentary for features I plan for other mods I may make in the
future, some of which I plan on making myself.
<br>
However, Tekora at this point in time is still heavily work in progress and as such
none of the ideas I mention may get implemented one day.
