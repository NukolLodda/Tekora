# Tekora
Source code of Tekora

Tekora is a tech based mod for Minecraft and a base mod for future mods planned for the Tekora Development Team.
<br>
Tekora plans to implement a whole host of machines into Minecraft using most naturally occuring elements of the<br>
periodic table

Here's the <a href="https://discord.gg/qAWK7Se4KC">discord server</a> for Tekora

-----
**Requests**

I mainly take bug fix requests and they will generally be my top priority
however, I will still take some requests to add or remove specific features
<br>
Tekora has a doc of planned features that should all be realized by version 4,
so unlike Modussy, Tekora just isn't as flexible.

-----
**Addons**
Tekora will likely have a couple of dependencies to it since some of the code
in Tekora is rudementary for features I plan for other mods I may make in the
future.
<br>
Currently, I plan for 3 addons, those being BioTekora, TekoraTransport, and
TekoraComputers. BioTekora will likely be the next one made as it also as of
right now, have a pseudo-completed draft.
<br>
These Tekora addons' source code will likely be placed in this repository

-----
**Permissions**

I permit anyone to go through this repository and copy minor snippets of the
sourcecode, meaning everyone can copy my code as they please, as long as the
final product of their use of my code is their own original work. However, if
you copy anything bigger than a single method, you have to credit me as the
original author behind the method, unless I credited someone else for said
method. However, I do NOT permit anyone to make a copy/replica of my mod unless
it is for versions of Minecraft this mod currently has no support on.
